            # What is Arduino?

            Arduino is two things:

            1. A tiny computer chip, on a "microcontroller" board (the Arduino board)
                - They come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, some are faster, some have more RAM and storage, some have more "I/O" connections, just like everyone's computer is different, so are Arduinos
            2. A program (IDE) you run on your computer to program your Arduino board
                - The IDE can program all kinds of different Arduino boards with all kinds of different Arduino chips
                - You use the IDE to program a Sketch, and then you Upload that Sketch to your Arduino board
                - Your Sketch tells the Arduino board what to do, and how to do it!

            # Analog vs. Digital
            
            - Digital pins can only deal with Input or Output that is either ON or OFF (1 or 0)
                - A switch is an appropriate input for a digital pin
                - An LED might be an appropriate output for a digital pin
            - Analog pins can deal with anything in between ON and OFF (a bit on, mostly off, really really on)
                - A sensor might be an appropriate output for an analog pin
                - A speaker might be an appropriate output for an analog pin

            - Variables are a way for you to hold information
            - You use them when you want to change that information, like when you count
            - You can check what they're holding, and decide what to do based on what you see

            ```
            
            - An `int` holds an Integer - that's a whole number (not a fraction)
            - The variable called `wait_time` is being assigned the number 1
            - It's like after this, everywhere you see `wait_time` you can substitute the number 1

            ```

            - You can change the number that wait_time is holding whenever you need, here we are multiplying it by `2`
            - After this happens, it will no longer be `1`! What is it now?

            # Functions
            
            - A function is like a recipe, it holds a bunch of instructions that you might want to do over and over
            - `loop()` is an example of a function - it is run by your Gemma over and over as long as it's powered on
            
            ```c
            void loop() {
                // ... instructions go here
            }
            ```
            
            - `void` just means that when you tell Gemma to run this function, it has nothing to say back to you
            - What if you wanted to write a function that calculated something and sent you back an Integer?

            # Function arguments

            Sometimes when you call a function, you want to give it some parameters...

            void blink_led( int how_many_times ) {
                // turn the led off and on as many times as we were asked

            # Setup

            Sometimes you just need to set things up before you can start. If you make a function called `setup()` Arduino will always call
            it before it starts calling `loop()`

            ```
            void setup() {
                pinMode(PIN_ONBOARD_LED, OUTPUT);
            }
            ```
            
            - `setup` is a great place to tell Arduino how you want to use its Input and Output pins
            - in this case, we are calling the Arduino `pinMode` function with two arguments indicating which pin, and whether we want that pin in `OUTPUT` or `INPUT` mode

            # Punctuation is important!
            
            - Notice how every function name like `setup` is preceded either by `void` or the type of information it returns
            - Every function name is followed by parantheses `(` and `)`
            - The arguments to the function are inside the parentheses
            - The body of the function starts with a brace-bracket `{` and ends with `}`
            - Every instruction has to end with a semi-colon `;`
            
            If anything goes wrong, the Arduino IDE will try and give you a hint, but it's not very smart.

            - If I asked the question "How do I make a jelly sandwich?" your answer (in sequential steps) would be an algorithm

            - Arduino provides some functions for you to do special things
            - We already saw how `pinMode` can set a pin to be an Input or an Output
            - We also saw how `digitalWrite` can turn an Output pin on or off (HIGH or LOW) to turn an LED on or off
            - We saw how we can use `delay` to pause for some number of milliseconds

            - just like water needs pressure to push it through a pipe, electric current needs some force to make it flow
            - a Volt is a measure of this electric pressure
            - the Gemma needs 3.3 Volts to operate, but has extra electronics to "regulate" the 5V from your computer's USB port
              - that's why it has both a 3Vo pin and a Vout pin; its "regulator" isn't very powerful so most of the time we'll want to
                use the Vout pin to (carefully!) power LEDs

            - just like the size of the pipe determines how much water can flow through it, the resistance of a circuit determines how much electricity can flow through it
            - resistors are like speed bumps, or like a tap on a faucet, sometimes you need some extra resistance in a circuit to stay safe and in control
            - we measure resistance in Ohms, and regular resistors are marked with coloured bands indicating how much they resist ie. brown-black-red is a 1,000 ohm resister (1K ohm)

            Put all workshop specific images in `framework/img/workshop`.

            All CSS is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).  Put all specific workshop customizations in `framework/sass/_workshop.scss`.  If you'd like to add an improvement or enhancement, please submit a pull request, open an issue or email [christina@ladieslearningcode.com](mailto:christina@ladieslearningcode.com).

            To change the background image in the intro slide, there are several images to choose from in `framework/img` or add your own. Make the change in `_workshop.scss`. CSS has already been included.

            The progress bar at the top of the page can be defined by adding the presentation duration, in minutes, in the `data-duration` attribute on the `body` tag.  If you do not want to use it at all, leave the value empty.

            Most of the the links included in the courses are external resources so all links open in a new window/tab by default to allow learners to always have access to the slides.  This feature is included using `
            <base target="_blank">` in the `head` tag.

            View the rest of the presentation for theme examples and more information about Markdown support and editable in-slide CSS examples.

            #Markdown support

            Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool and allows you to write using plain text formatting. See the [Markdown docs](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for syntax.

            Because the workshop content is written primarily in Markdown, white space should be preserved. View the readme file for instructions.

            To use Markdown, include the `data-markdown` attribute in the section tag and add the content in `script` tags.

            <pre><code>&lt;section class=&quot;slide&quot; data-markdown&gt;
                &lt;script type=&quot;text/template&quot;&gt;
                #This is markdown!
                &lt;/script&gt;
                &lt;/section&gt;
            </code></pre>

            Markdown supports content in regular HTML as well, so you can switch between using Markdown & HTML in the same slide, with the exception of `script` tags.

            For `script` tags, you will need to escape the brackets.
        </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
            #Markdown Support

            Code blocks can be added with three back ticks `(```)`.

            Add the language immediately after the first set of back ticks will allow you to specify a language for syntax highlighting. View the HTML source for the below examples to see the markdown formatting.

            ## Javascript Example:

            ```javascript
            var myJSVariable = "Syntax Highlighting for JavaScript";
            ```

            ## CSS Example
            ```css
            .css-selector {
            property: value;
            }
            ```

            ## HTML Example
            For HTML, you can set the language to `html` or `xml`.

            ```html
            <header>
                <h1>I'm an H1!</h1>
                <p>This is a paragraph</p>
            </header>
            ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
            #Markdown Support

            Add an attribute like this:

            ```html
            Text with a class.<!-- .element: class="some-style" -->
            ```
            Will be converted to:

            ```
            <p class="some-style">Text with a class.</p>
            ```

            Be sure to place the snippet before any nested elements.
            ```
            Text and a <!-- .element: class="some-style" --> [link](http://website.com)
            ```
            Will be converted to:

            ```
            <p class="some-style">Text and a <a href="http://hakim.se">link</a>.</p>
            ```

            #Syntax Highlighting

            Code highlighting courtesy of [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) and will be applied to any code wrapped in `
            <pre><code></code></pre>`.

            The theme files are located in **framework > css > highlightjs**. Visit [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) to see the full list of supported languages, themes and other usage information.

            Using a light theme for slide presentations works better for classroom settings that don't allow for the dimming of lights. Some projectors don't show syntax highlighting on dark backgrounds very well.

            ##Getting your site online

            You will need to register a domain name and purchase hosting. Here are some suggestions:

            * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - domains and hosting - use promo code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!
            * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - domains - save 10% with the promo code "learningcode"

            Why keep your domains and hosting separate?<!-- .element: class="note" --> [Learn more about Hover](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

            You will also need to upload your files to your hosting server. You will need some info usually provided by your hosting service provider: FTP Address, Username, Password.

            Here's a tutorial getting your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
